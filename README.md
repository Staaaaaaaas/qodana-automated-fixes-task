# JetBrains Test Task
Test task for "Automated fixes development for Qodana" project.
## Task 1
The first task is solved by forming a graph of relations between characters. 
This graph must be a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), and the resulting alphabet is the topological sort of this graph.

There are tests written to check the correctness of the solution.

## Task 2
The second task is simplified with the usage of `kotlinx.serialization` library. 
If we correctly write the model for `Problem`, such that the required equality check works, the task becomes trivial.
